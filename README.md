## Setup

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables by copying the example file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Edit the `.env` file with your secure passwords
5. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore` - it should not be committed)

2. **Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/)** and connect your GitHub repository

3. **Configure Secrets in Streamlit Cloud:**
   - In your Streamlit Cloud app dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Secrets"
   - Add the following secrets (replace with your secure values):
   
   ```toml
   # Streamlit Cloud Secrets (TOML format)
   QUIZ_PASSWORD = "your_secure_quiz_password_here"
   ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your_secure_admin_password_here"
   ENVIRONMENT = "production"
   ```

4. **Deploy the app** - Streamlit Cloud will automatically deploy your app

**Important Security Notes for Deployment:**
- Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub
- Use strong, unique passwords for production
- Environment variables for passwords are required and must be set before deployment

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set in the `.env` file:

- `QUIZ_PASSWORD`: Master password for encrypting quiz data
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password for accessing the admin panel
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Set to "development" or "production"

## Streamlit Data Management

This application leverages Streamlit's powerful data handling capabilities:

### Session State Management
- **User Progress Tracking**: Quiz progress and scores are maintained across page interactions using `st.session_state`
- **Admin Authentication**: Login status persists throughout the admin session
- **Quiz State Persistence**: Current question, answers, and navigation state are preserved

### Data Storage and Caching
- **Encrypted Database**: Quiz questions and user data are stored in encrypted format
- **Performance Optimization**: Streamlit's caching mechanisms (`@st.cache_data`) optimize data loading
- **Real-time Updates**: Leaderboard and quiz statistics update dynamically

### Data Display Components
- **Interactive Tables**: User scores and leaderboards displayed using `st.dataframe`
- **Progress Visualization**: Quiz progress shown with `st.progress` bars
- **Dynamic Charts**: Score distributions and statistics using Streamlit's charting capabilities
- **Form Handling**: Quiz submissions and admin forms managed through `st.form`

### Data Security
- **Encrypted Storage**: All sensitive data encrypted before storage
- **Session Isolation**: User data isolated per session
- **Secure State Management**: Admin privileges managed through secure session state

## Technical Highlights

- Modular function design with reusable components
- Efficient CSS with consolidated responsive breakpoints
- Clean separation of concerns between UI and logic
- Type hints for better code documentation
- Streamlit-native data handling for optimal performance

## Security Notes

- The `.env` file and database files are excluded from git via `.gitignore`
- Encryption keys are generated from passwords using PBKDF2
- Admin passwords are compared using constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
